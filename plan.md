# 🎉 Tier-Based Event Showcase - Project Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Tier-Based Event Showcase** is a modern web application that demonstrates a membership-tiered event system where users can view different events based on their subscription tier. This project showcases authentication, database integration, and conditional content rendering based on user permissions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Authentication System**: Implement secure user authentication using Clerk.dev
2. **Tier-Based Access Control**: Create a system where users see events based on their membership tier
3. **Event Management**: Display events with proper filtering and beautiful UI
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application works seamlessly across all devices
5. **Modern Tech Stack**: Utilize Next.js 14 App Router with latest best practices

### Secondary Goals
1. **User Experience**: Smooth transitions, loading states, and intuitive navigation
2. **Scalability**: Clean code architecture that can be easily extended
3. **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and efficient data fetching
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for future developers

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Components**: Reusable React components with TypeScript support
- **State Management**: React state with server-side data fetching

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login → Clerk Authentication → Metadata Extraction → Tier Determination → Event Filtering
```

### Database Schema
```
Events Table:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- title (Text)
- description (Text)
- event_date (Timestamp)
- image_url (Text)
- tier (Enum: free, silver, gold, platinum)
```

## 🔐 User Tier System

### Tier Hierarchy
1. **Free Tier**: Access to free events only
2. **Silver Tier**: Access to free + silver events
3. **Gold Tier**: Access to free + silver + gold events
4. **Platinum Tier**: Access to all events (free + silver + gold + platinum)

### Access Logic
- Users can only see events for their tier and below
- Tier information is stored in Clerk's user metadata
- Database queries filter events based on allowed tiers

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Authentication**: Clerk.dev
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Key Dependencies
- `@clerk/nextjs`: Authentication and user management
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Database client
- `tailwindcss`: Utility-first CSS framework

## 📱 User Interface Design

### Pages Structure
```
/                    - Landing page with login
/events             - Protected events listing (main page)
/upgrade            - Tier upgrade simulation (bonus)
```

### Component Architecture
```
Layout
├── Header (with authentication controls)
├── Main Content
│   ├── EventGrid
│   │   ├── EventCard
│   │   ├── TierBadge
│   │   └── LoadingState
│   └── UserControls
└── Footer
```

### Design Principles

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Event Loading Process
1. User authenticates via Clerk
2. System extracts user tier from metadata
3. Application determines allowed tiers (current tier + below)
4. Database query filters events by allowed tiers
5. Events are rendered in responsive grid layout

### Tier Upgrade Process
1. User clicks upgrade button
2. System updates user metadata in Clerk
3. Page refreshes or re-fetches data
4. New events become visible based on upgraded tier

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
