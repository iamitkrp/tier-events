## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router (latest stable)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 (cutting edge, but stable)
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript setup for type safety
- **File Structure**: src/ directory for cleaner organization

### Upcoming Decisions
- Clerk authentication strategy (custom vs. prebuilt components)
- Supabase RLS policy implementation approach
- UI component library choice (build custom vs. use Radix UI)
- State management approach (built-in React vs. external library)

### Performance Considerations
- Next.js Image optimization for event images
- Lazy loading for event cards
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- CDN integration for static assets
